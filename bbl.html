            To be honest, I'm pretty behind on homework and trying to catch up as fast as I can.
            So I decided to prioritize having a site rather than trying to fight through these difficult readings so I can just get it done.
            Enjoy some placeholder text and the most default video I could think of. 
            I'm essentially just making this a display of functionality that hopefully shows I'm not hopeless with design.
            And then there's some computer-y energy going on with the background image for the vibes.
            <div class="frame">
            <iframe 
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMfPqeZjc2c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen
                style="width: 175%; height: 100%"></iframe>
            </iframe>
            </div>
            I'm now including more text so that the scroll functionality I put into this container is actually used when I have the window fullscreened.
            I'm also running out of things to say, but I'm trying to avoid this becoming a stream of consciousness because this is still a homework assignment.
            Anyway if any of my classmates who are on campus this semester read this for some reason, you should come see Much Ado About Nothing 10/24-25 on Walsh Lawn.
            You should also watch Spring Awakening online 10/15-18 but I didn't pour my heart and soul into that one, I just did some scheduling.
