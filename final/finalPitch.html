    <h1>Final Project: To Do List</h1>
    <p>
        My goal for the final project is to create a site on which you can add items to your to do list, mark them as complete, and delete them.
        I'm using jQuery to do so. The items will be displayed in the order of the due date input when they are created, but can also be filtered by their status: Incomplete, Complete, or Recently Deleted.
        The challenge of this will be to use local storage so it can be opened and closed over time.
        Once that's functional, I'd like to add a sign-in function that allows you to create multiple lists, which are password protected.
